This is great and really exciting to hear, thank you both so much!

I'm really interested in anything you've been thinking or planning for personalized bibliometrics, and of course would love to see code behind the published WoS analysis as a starting point.




##joel's comments
Hmm,, nature of many of your questions seem either like something that you will know once they forward it (language) or more frequently, something that warrants a skype/phone call to really talk about effectively. Moreover, your draft is a significant increase in volume from their (remarkably quick) rather concise responses.

I would propose an enthusiastic yes + thank + this is great news, followed by a statement that you are eagerly awaiting whatever they can share, and finally, perhaps a proposal to do a hangout and chat about ways to collaborate/move forward on it.

just my two cents.

Hi

 1. wow thank you okay this is a better response than anticipated
 2. have you done anything yet/is this just an embryonic idea?
  * follow up: what language is the original thing written in?  
 3. I've been bumping against the proprietary WoS issue for a while; does your analysis rely on having all of that data downloaded already? Would it work with a script that fetched full names and geographical information on command (e.g. using DOI lookups)

Would you consider starting with just a gender analyzer

 * if you've run any self-metrics already on papers?
 * kinds of infrastructure that you're envisioning -- plans or projects already in motion?
