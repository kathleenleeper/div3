basically, all of nina de jesus' writing @ [satifice](satifice.github.io) (now a part of the big zotero library)
 * [why open access is doomed](https://satifice.github.io/2014/10/24/some-thoughts-on-why-open-access-is-doomed)
 * [democratization of 'information' and authority](https://satifice.github.io/2014/08/11/the-democratization-of-the-web-and-authority/): what authorities count as valid? - working off of entirely OA resources that *also* count as valid scholarly sources

  "Take for example the United States, where the National Science Foundation (NSF), which funds research ranging from physics to psychology, received an appropriation of $6.9 billion for the year 2013. The Dutch government has allocated a budget of 800 million euroâ€™s in 2013 for research and science policy."

This doesn't account for the money flow from the Pentagon or DARPA or military sources overall, or the money private companies (blackwater? boeing? venture cap. -- re regenerative medicine @ wakeforest -- and biotech?) are pushing into biomed research
