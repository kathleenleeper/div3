 -- since we consider profit to be the driving motive, and conventionally,
 keeping things secret (and thus scarce) is the key to keeping profits high
 for the owner.

If the driving motive is changed or modified: to usefulness, or some moral

 vs.

 then openness becomes a more reasonable justification.
 Making things accessible, copy-able, less restrictive, seems the answer
 to making products/information usable for the people we're interested in
 helping, namely users and

\begin_layout Standard
Then, of course, co-option enters the picture.
 It was there before, but at least there was some ghost of legal power to
 determine who could use your stuff.
 In academics, of course, there was no such power -- giving up copyright
 to journals meant anyone with dollars and cents could access that information;
 the point is, with openness, comes the risk that the product will be used
 and abused.
 In the case of Linux, the U.S.' use of Linux-based system on nuclear warheads,
 navy submarines, and other mechanisms of war is not exactly a

 consequence of Linux's availability.
 Anthropological, ethnographic, and other social descriptors are also used
 by governments and people in power to better manipulate and control typically
 marginalized groups.
 Point: releasing your data to run free increases the chance of the wrong
 groups catching, breeding, and doing unapproved things.

logic behind continuining to open
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So then what to do? One option: go back/never leave closed systems where
 you exert some form of control.
 This, of course, is just as vulnerable -- governments and powerful groups
 can bend the rules, buy the products: if they want access, it's not hard
 to get, not really.
 Especially with mass surveillance, technology tools, etc.
 So closed source is no protection, not really, against those with power.

So, damned if you open, damned if you don't.
 For those worried about their work being used in a way they didn't intend:
 no point in worrying, it's happening no matter what.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, it seems to me that the best option is to do what you can to help
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the little guy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in the form of making your thing as readily accessible and easy to use
 as possible.
 Ideally, I guess, you could make it have no government usefulness at all
 -- but then it's probably not useful to anybody else.
 Fighting co-option has to come from somewhere else, whether in the form
 of embedding it into the software somehow in the form of usage notes or
 manuals or guiding principles, but it doesn't work to close it off.
 So despite the risk -- certainity -- of misuse, opening up seems like it
 will do more good than harm.
