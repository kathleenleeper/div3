\begin_layout Standard
to have explicit methods, methods should be standardized to be computer
 readable -- and negative results must be acceptable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There must be an acknowledgement of the biases inherent to our science,
 and it seems like the only way to exorcise those biases and produce truly
 better knowledge -- better, in this case, being the creation of a model
 that more closely approximates and can explain data, with the understanding
 that it is just a model

  -- is by opening up the processes to everyone, and making knowledge creation
 a collaborative procedure.
 Not a given -- there can still be scientists working by themselves, but
 what the work they do must be accessible, reproducible, and explainable.
 Wikipedia is great; we all use it to enhance our understanding.
 Reagants and analysis software have to be accessible, for full replication
 of results.
 Data has to be available, for re-analysis or re-interpretation or making
 your own damn graphs.
 Your sources -- the reason you did something -- has to be open access,
 so that people can go back and back and check everything for themselves
 and remove our helpless dependence on abstracts.
 Which isn't to say papers and abstracts won't be valuable, but scientists
 need to be held accountable for the knowledge they publish and the ways
 in which those publications ripple outwards.

possible consequences - positive

\begin_layout Standard
The entire process needs to be open and accessible, not intentionally obfuscated
, which will allow a number of things to happen that relate to SJ - one,
 underprivileged practicitioners (underfunded universities, DIY-scientists,
 fledgling programs) will be able to replicate, build on, and use the data
 we have.
 Science will become more accountable -- the conclusions, data, methodology,
 and all other aspects will be demystified and laid bare to public scrutiny,
 which will allow all sorts of people to weigh in.
 Feminists critiquing assumptions, other scientists fact and method checking
 or modifying, data crunchers investigating conclusions, improvement of
 metanalyses (allowing metaanalyses to actually happen) Science will become
 more accessible -- no longer locked in the ivory tower of privileged institutio
ns, people -- and i'm talking 15 year olds and 85 year olds, people from
 South Africa to Iceland -- can read, access, and understand the medical
 establishment that rules so much of our lives, the science behind

\begin_layout Standard
this also requires a fundamental shift in the intent of publishing.
 While i'm not arguing for a monolithic database that catalogs research
 into predetermined categories, i am arguing for a collectivist and socialist
 form of science, where we give credit to information (perhaps some sort
 of autotagging?), the goal will not be publication in science, and jargon,
 in the derogatory sense, should be avoided and exorcised.
 the intentionally vague or performative technical language should be eradicated
, if possible, and if not, there should be a service that provides automatic
 services of informing the general public, and also, goddamn, have a

which brings me to software -- better PDF readers that serve the needs of
 a public that wants to be informed (maybe something like banshee's wikipedia
 section!!), and a form of abstracts that is catalogable and better keywords.

it does lead to the potential for codifying our way of thinking, about genes
 for example...if you can just pull up everything on FoxA2 and other gene interacti
ons, it might prevent a different way of thinking about--considering them
 in the context of pathways as opposed to their stated functionality, maybe.

slightly less work in the beginning leads to a heavy load of cost (licensing),

 western support), vulnerability to the governments that own corporations,
