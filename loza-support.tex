To the school of HACU:\thispagestyle{empty}

My experiences with Professor Loza have been almost entirely in the
classroom, and those of science student wandering into unfamiliar
territory\@. In my second semester at Hampshire, as a first year
developing a social conscience, I took her Sample! Remix! Mash! class.
A year later, I enrolled in The Politics of Popular Culture. \\


Both classes played an enormous role in my development as a critical
and analytical thinker, as a writer able to develop independent work,
and as an individual engaged in activism both on and off campus. Professor
Loza's own incredible work ethic pairs with a dedication to students
and to her field; she expects, demands, and believes that her students
will rise to the same standards. That belief in our abilities to read
the intricate papers that make up cultural studies, and to produce
serious and meaningful work of our own, pushed me to delve deeply
into my topic and stretch my mental capacities. She is never unprepared
for class; she considers all the possibilities for a class discussion
to take and comes equipped with media files to demonstrate each one
and provide real examples for each topic. \\


I've also had the somewhat unique and excellent experience of working
with Professor Loza while not being a media studies concentrator;
I often felt in both my NS classes and HACU classes to be the odd
one out. Professor Loza, however, effectively bridged that gap, working
with me to connect the analytical and critical methods in her classes
to my other academic work in the sciences. I wrote two major papers
for her: one on scientific publishing, and one on public perceptions
of science as mediated by social media. She was willing to meet on
a regular basis and help me through difficult and complex questions;
her feedback on papers and written work was simultaneously encouraging,
thought-provoking, and offered many 

In the process, she helped me refine my writing and research about
media and science alike. My experiences and lessons from her classes
have proved useful and meaningful innumerable times since, and are
a foundational part of my current Division III project in feminist
neuroscience. \\


Professor Loza has been crucial in challenging and developing both
my own and other student's academic and personal efforts; she contributes
to the legacy of activism on campus and consistently ties academic
theory to hard reality. It is largely due to the classes she's taught
and her efforts to work with me that I feel competent and able to
engage with political and social activism on campus and in the world.
Her importance in mine and other students growth and development makes
her a crucial part of the school, and the classes and support she
provides seem irreplaceable. I would like nothing more than to see
her reappointed and continuing to help Hampshire students grow and
blossom into critical thinkers and writers.
