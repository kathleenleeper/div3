#this project
"An interdisciplinary exploration"... of psychedelic drugs and molecular neuroscience, opening scientific ecosystems, and being a fucking feminist/reconstructive scientist. Read the giant PDF above to find out more.  Final draft coming April 25th, 2015.

There is also a repo corresponding to just my molecular lab work, available [here](https://github.com/kathleenleeper/workhorse), although it is less up to date than it could be.

###div 3
Division III projects at Hampshire are in some cases the equivalent of a Master's thesis. Students take a maximum of two classes and complete a large independent project in their field under the guidance of 2-4 advisors.

#this repo
Contains all of the files that might be submitted to my committee; it's mostly for me. As in: I'm the only contributor, because I have a love affair with git.
