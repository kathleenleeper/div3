Division III is a year long undergraduate thesis project; for me, it's both
 problematizing and exploring solutions to those problems.
 I began with neuroscience, and a naive fascination with pathologies of
 the brain and perception.
 I have since learned or come to believe that my interests, and what I do
 with those interests, has an impact on the world -- this is both self-presevera
tion, for otherwise what's the point? and self-recrimination; my impact
 on the world is my responsibility, and I need to figure out ways to meld
 a shattered world view into a practice that has tangible effects on the
 people and society around me.
 People are society; if we don't change them, we cannot begin to move forward.
 Change can come from the top or the bottom, but we write the laws, we execute
 them, and we -- humans -- create our societys.
 To wit.

The pathologies of the brain are still intriguing, but so loaded with societal
 implications that I cannot try to unravel them without also examining the
 long term effect of my research, specifically, but more broadly the impact
 of cellular-level research etc.
 on vulnerable (vulnerability being conferred by long-standing encoded discrimin
ation that results in genetic, economic, or social exclusion [or the potential
 thereof]) groups.
 One solution I found early in my tenuous and at the time exploratory/unguided
 phase was free/libre software and its sibling in the sciences, open science.
 While to my current chagrin much of open science does not appear (at first
 glance, at least) to be founded on the same moral basis as Stallman's GNU/libre
 brainchild, it is nonetheless science that shares much of that moral spirit.
 On both practical levels and a deeper moral level, open science seemed
 justifiable and

 for the same reason free software and free culture feel

 -- they are technologies and creations with care beyond a profit motive,
 and give more than a token nod to users.
 Users have power.
 In open science, scientists can reclaim power (by taking control of distributio
n, by interacting with the common folk, by engaging in conversations), although
 it's of course limited to only one direction and to limited effect.

Open science derives from many places.
 It has its origins in science as we know it today, where it was practiced
 in England and France by wealthy (largely white and male) folks with time
 on their hands.

Science

 found its roots in curiosity, in spare time, in exploration for the sake
 of exploration.
 Probably not totally true, but I believe there's a grain of truth.
 Journals were free because anyone who did science was high-profile enough
 to afford them; you paid for long distance or translations or whatever.
 Tesla was probably different.
 Fleck was different.
 Many scientists or practicioners were different;;;;; so maybe I'm wrong.

But all that said; there is nonetheless a perception of science as a brotherhood
, a fraternity, a cult of fathers and sons, of inquisitive boys learning
 to harness their curiosity and work in harmony with their brethren around
 the world to help humanity.
 Thus, sharing.
 Because science is philanthropic and interested in progress, not profit,
 and because the heartbeat of progress is experiments and papers and data,
 sharing those can only create progress.
 Thus, it's the way science is going.

What open science looks like in the Western academies, what it looks like
 from my spot in the academy of the United States, is removing cost barriers,
 removing license barriers, and conceiving of the scientific process as
 a sort of inside out building; possibly uglier, but more effective as a
 building.
