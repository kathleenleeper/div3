Fear and Loathing for Science: Hallucinogenic Plasticity

\begin_layout Abstract
Hallucinogens have been used for centuries as spiritual aids and guidance.
 While there are any number of mind-altering substances, the classical hallucino
gens are perceptually and molecularly distinct from other classes.
 5-HT2a hallucinogenic ligands differentially regulate intracellular signaling,
 transcription processes, and cell excitability in the neocortex, leading
 to wide-ranging brain changes in the long and short term.
 The synthesis of LSD in 1938 and the subsequent rise of recreational drug
 use in the 60s cut short the flood of research on the hallucinogenic potential
 for treating anxiety, depression, pain, addictions, and compulsions, among
 other things.
 However, in recent years, researchers have begun to unravel the processes
 of plasticity underlying therapeutic processes.

 in the 1930s set off twenty years of furious research in psychiatry into
 potential therapies relating to anxiety disorders, obsessiveâ€“compulsive
 disorders, depression, addiction, and sexual dysfunctions, among others.
 Many also focused on hallucinogens as a type of model psychosis, an easily
 induced and quantifiable form of schizophrenia.
 Admittedly, most of this research was primarily anecdotal, suffered from
 a lack of controls and followup, and had almost no ethical regulations
 in comparison to today's standards for any human-related experiment

.
 However, LSD synthesis also brought a host of highly potent compounds to
 a recreational audience, and the fierce political backlash in the United
 States unfortunately brought research to a grinding halt by the 1970s.
 Until the 1990s, hallucinogens existed primarily in religious ceremonies
 and as recreational drugs, and only very slowly have made their way into
 the line of scientific inquiry in a few highly regulated and prestigious
 laboratories.

 mind-altering.

To narrow the working definition down from general perceptual, somatic,

 hallucinogens are also non-toxic and non-addictive, do not induce stupor

 They can also be characterized by their molecular structure and receptor
 binding affinity.

Animal models for hallucinogenic assessment are often mice or rabbits, although
 rabbits are excessively susceptible to drug effects.
 In the classic differentiation task, mice are dosed with a known hallucinogen
 (typically DOI) and trained to respond when similar compounds arise.
 When dosed with classical hallucinogens, mice exhibit a consistent head
 twitch response (HTR), which can then used as a measure of hallucinogenic
 potency for other compounds.
 HTR is reliably elicited by a variety of proven hallucinogenic compounds,
 but is conspicuously absent with non-hallucinogens and in 5-HT2a-knock
 out mice, who demonstrate no behavioral reaction to hallucinogens

 Eliciting the mechanisms of this discrepancy is an important indicator
 in determining how hallucinogens affect the brain and differentially regulate
 plasticity.
 One quantitative measure of differences in ligand signaling is the phospholipas
e release and accumulation as a results of an intracellular signaling cascade.
 While any activation of the 5-HT2a receptor sets offs both PLA2 (phospholipase
 A) release and PLC (phospholipase C) accumulation through heterotrimic
 G proteins, the efficiency of each cascade varies from compound to compound.

 In the prefrontal cortex, serotonin receptors are localized on the apical
 dendrites of pyramidal cells in the deep layer IV and superficial layer
 V.
 The raphe nucleus (R) sends serotonin projections to forebrain structures,
 notably the frontal cortex.
 Hallucinogens reduce the firing rate of raphe cells, either by direct stimulati
on of inhibitory 5-HT1A receptors or by 5-HT2a receptor activation of inhibitory
 GABA interneurons.
 Cessation or reduction of raphe cell firing leads to a disruption of normal
 serotonergic activity, including reduced activation of inhibitory 5-HT1A
 receptors on cortical pyramidal axons.
 Incoming sensory information is processed through the thalamus, with modulation
 by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, which has afferents from some
 thalamic nuclei and associated cortical areas.
 Many thalamic nuclei as well as the reticular nucleus express 5-HT2a receptors.
 Alterations in the firing mode of thalamic neurons are associated with
 dramatic changes in the neuronâ€™s responsiveness to peripheral stimuli.
 The locus couerulus (LC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) express 5-HT2a
 receptors and also receive pre-modified input from the raphe, and then
 send it elsewhere.
 The LC sends noradrenergic projections to both thalamus and cortex, and
 hallucinogens potentiate burst firing in LC neurons in response to novel
 stimuli.
 The VTA is the origin of dopaminergic cells, and are depolarized by activation
 of 5-HT2a receptors, which would potentially lead to enhanced release of
 DA in cortex.
 he somatosensory and sensory association cortex, responsible for cortical-thala
mic timing regulation as well as merely processing sensory information,
 also expresses 5-HT2a receptors, a potential explanation for hallucinogenic
 time distortion

 Popular culture is rife with talk of 'bad trips'--terrifying descents into

 violent and self-destructive behavior.
 Clinically, there is documentation of flashbacks and persistent revisiting

Before benefits, there is the incidence of hallucinogen persisting perception
 disorder (HPPD) to consider.
 HPPD has 3 component parts in today's definition, according to the DSM-IV:
 re-experiencing one or more of the perceptual symptoms experienced while
 hallucinogenically intoxicated; clinically significant distress or impairment
 in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning due to
 the revisited symptoms; and not due to a general medical condition (such
 as anatomical lesions and infections of the brain, visual epilepsies) or
 better accounted for by another mental disorder (schizophrenia, psychoses,
 dementia, etc).
 Much of the research on what is now called HPPD is more than 20 years old,
 when ethics were less of a concern and studies often did not feature appropriat
e controls, definition of terms, similar methodologies, and lacked many
 details required to formally diagnose HPPD

 A review of much of the research on flashbacks and long-term effects came
 away with conclusions to inform any hallucinogen uses.
 First, flashbacks have been defined too many times in the literature to
 have any functional meaning left.
 Even with the data restricted to reports similar to the diagnosis of HPPD
 as defined by the DSM, the studies vary widely in estimates of prevalence--from
 essentially no users experiencing lingering effects to as high as 77%.
 There is also a lack of accounting for alternate factors like psychotic
 disorders prior to ingestion or other potentially traumatizing non-related
 incidents.
 Controlled laboratory evidence and assessment of prevalence also has serious
 flaws, as controlled settings see less long lasting negative effects because
 of selection bias of non-psychotic, fully informed, and not overdosed patients
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Essentially, while persisting negative effects are genuine, they tend to
 be isolated and rare, and are often associated with patients already suffering
 from trauma or psychological disorders.

Conclusion & Future Research

\begin_layout Standard
The mechanisms of hallucinogenic plasticity have only begun to be explored.
 While the Schedule I ban on nearly all forms of naturally-occuring or synthesiz
ed hallucinogens has severely hindered research, the past ten years have
 experienced an upsurge in hallucinogenically-related publications.
 Classical hallucinogens have yet to show any risk to autonomic functioning,
 unlike alcohol, tobacco, and cough syrup, which are all available as over
 the counter drugs.
 Psychologically, there is some incidence of long-term persisting negative
 effects, but this has not been seen in any clinical trials with proper
 controls and therapy options.
 Hallucinogenic regulation of gene transcription and synaptic density may
 be important regulators of their efficacy in treating a variety of psychologica
l disorders and anxiety, and significantly improve the quality of life for
 terminally ill patients.
