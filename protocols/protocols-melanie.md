title: differentiating P19s

###Why?

P19 stem cells differentiate into neuron-like cells when exposed to 1 mM trans-retinoic acid (RA). While RA technically only needs to be added for the first 3 days or so to set cell fate, we keep it on RA.

###protocol

####reagants

 * retinoic acid (-20 C freezer, in the corner with trypsin; kept in tinfoil to prevent light exposure and degradation)
 * MEMalpha with 1% FBS
 * sparse-ish P19, preferably at a low pass number

####do:

 1. Take off any current media (typically 5%) and wash the cells with PBS gently (if this is Day 0 of differentiation). P19s throw off a lot of stuff.
 2. Add 1.5 mls MEMalpha with 1% FBS
  * the less FBS, the better they differentiate, but also the faster they die. Its a balance. 
 3. Add 1.5 uls of the RA to the center of the dish; swirl!
  * a cool thing happens where the RA must be very hydrophobic, so a tiny clear spot will appear where you pipette it in

 4. Do this again 3 days later!
  * P19s are delicate infants; please don't wash them if they're in the process of throwing out processes.


title: RNA extraction from P19s

###Why?
Extracting, isolating, and quantiating RNA expression allows us to build a timeline of the "usual" P19 differentiation expression levels, and then compare it to what happens with the introduction of different transcription factors. Step 1: Kill cells, collect cell lysate to later do an RNA extraction en masse.

###Do

 1. Wash cells in 35mm dish 2x with PBS (wash= add ~1ml PBS and aspirate).
   * unless you're using delicate cells that don't need washing, like delicate differentiating P19s
  2. Add 1 mL of TRIZOL Reagent to the dish and pipette up and down to make sure all the cells are really dead and really broken up. 
  4. Scrape TRIZOL/lysed cells into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge; scrape! Get ALL of the stuff.
 5. Incubate the homÂ­ogenized samples for 5 minutes at room temperature 
   * the complete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes. 

<b> Store the suspension @ -80, label with date & other pertinent information </b>


###why?

sometimes cells are too confluent and we need less of them! P19s grow fast, so even with a 1:9 split (no counting @ Hampshire), they need to be split every 5-6 days, and fed every three days.

###do

####reagants

 * MEMalpha, with some percent FBS depending on your task. 5% for normal maintenance.
 * trypsin

  1. Aspirate media, rinse with PBS
  2. Add .5 ml trypsin and wait for cells to shake loose
   * if you're not me, you'll actually let them hang out in the incubator and dissociate properly
   3. Add 1.5 ml media to deactivate trypsin
   4. add .2 mls cells and 1.8 mls media to each plate for a ~1:9 split
