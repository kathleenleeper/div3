 The scientific project

\begin_inset Quotes erd

; the intense, methodological, and highly-specific technoscientific answers
 we seek in scientific inquiry are building blocks to theories.
 To stand on those shoulders, we need communication -- we collaborate within
 buildings and between labs, we maintain social ties that influence gifts
 of stem cell lines and antibodies, we go out to bars at conferences, we
 track the ever-cresting wave of published academic research.
 Science is yes, the experiment, but the experiment and information gathered
 by others goes hand in hand.

Part of the problem is that none of these articles were co-written by a

 The investigators collected their samples, returned home and published

 Few Liberians were then trained in laboratory or epidemiological methods.

We find that even with the institution-specific discounts re- sulting from
 bundled purchases, the prices per citation charged to large PhD-granting
 universities by major commercial publishers are much higher than those
 charged by major nonprofit publish- ers.
 Among the commercial publishers in our study, Elsevier’s prices per citation
 are nearly 3 times those charged by the non- profits, whereas Emerald,
 Sage, and Taylor & Francis have prices per citation that are roughly 10
 times those of the nonprofits.
 For smaller PhD-granting institutions (Carnegie research 2), the price
 per citation from Elsevier’s big deal bundle was roughly similar to that
 charged by the average nonprofit publisher, whereas prices per citation
 from the other for-profits were two to four times as high as those of the
 nonprofits.

Pooling together results, it is argued, maximises the chances of spotting

 data into knowledge (OECD 2009, Royal Society 2012).
 This in turn may improve the quality, accessibility and transparency of
 research and speed up the rate of scientific discovery.

Reproducibility is not replication.

 There’s often honest confusion between the notion of reproducibility and
 what I would call a “full replication”.
 A full replication doesn't analyze the same dataset, but rather involves
 an independent investigator collecting an independent dataset conducting
 an independent analysis.
 Full replication has been a fundamental component of science for a long
 time now and will continue to be the primary yardstick for measuring the
 plausibility of scientific claims.
 I think most would agree that full replication is preferable, but often
 it is simply not possible.

The principle of the elusive scientific method is reproducibility.
 Researchers document their methods and results to such an extent that any
 other researcher is able to replicate their data independently, or, more
 ideally, build experiments atop the results of their colleagues.
 With reproducibility, two different labs should produce similar types of
 results (e.g.
 protein-protein interactions) with different methods (e.g.
 protein inhibitors, mutagenesis studies).

The file drawer effect, or file drawer problem, is that many studies in

 that are not reported may on average report different results from those
 that are reported.
 An extreme scenario is that a given null hypothesis of interest is in fact
 true, i.e.
 the association being studied does not exist, but the 5% of studies that
 by chance show a statistically significant result are published, while
 the remaining 95% where the null hypothesis was not rejected languish in

 The file drawer effect inteferes with this, by hiding the decline effect.
 Because the first papers to describe results are often underpowered and
 thus overexaggerate the magnitude of an effect, subsequent studies often
 find non-significant results; because these are negatives, they are harder
 to publish and self-correction takes longer.

 repeat offenders, adjusting for literature growth), they assert that research
 misconduct of the fraud variety underlie most retractions; i.e.
 the retraction rate is likely due to social factors, not changes in rigor
 or intentional deception.

Summary

\begin_layout Standard
So the 
\emph on
validity
\emph default
 of scientific communications is in questions, largely due to the unit of
 published literature and the pressures on scientists to create certain
 specific kinds of knowledge.
 There is issues of access to the literature; but even that literature does
 not fill all the knowledge gaps.
 It is subject to funding whims, human biases in selection criteria, concerns
 about prestige, often statistical bunk, occasionally outright fraud that
 isn't always caught on.
 Publishing is the outlet for most of these, but the problems run much deeper,
 into the very beginnings of scientific projects.
 What kinds of systems could re-create a scientific ecosystem that was not
 subject to these things, or at least remained flexible enough to continually
 re-prioritize the accuracy of scientific work and the, ahem, pursuit of
 truth?

High-impact journals tend to have higher retraction rates.
 Why, and how?

\begin_layout Quote
On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of instituti
onalizing journal rank as an impact measure.
 So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal
 rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or
 relied on only a few studies.
 The most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly
 communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality
 (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or
 retractions) corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an
 assessment tool is bad scientific practice.

Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the
 currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact.

So what can we do to return to how things once were? The rewards of science
 rise out of publications, but simply publishing does not guarantee success.
 We are increasingly judged according to where we publish rather than what
 we publish.
 Remarkably, we are ranked in proportion to the number of citations garnered
 by the other papers in the journals that contain our papers (the impact
 factor).
 
\series bold
Some organizations decide promotions and grant applications on the basis
 of the impact factors of the journals that publish a scientist’s papers.

 So,

rewards come from being published in the journals with the highest impact
 factors.

 As a result, the perception of the need for this kind of reward runs strong
 and deep.

The science base in the developing world cannot be strengthened without
 access to the global library of research information.
 Currently, this is nearly impossible due to the high costs of journal subscript
ions, with the result that even the most prestigious institutes in poorer
 counries cannot afford to buy the journals they need.
 Many initiatives have been started to resolve the access problem, but progress
 has been slow and, since they are generally dependent on grants or subsidies,
 are unlikely to be long-term solutions.
 With the advent of the Open Access (OA) initiative, the outlook for building
 science capacity in developing countries has improved significantly.
 In particular, the establishment of interoperable open access archives
 that is now underway by a rapidly growing number of institutes opens opportunit
ies for true global knowledge exchange.
