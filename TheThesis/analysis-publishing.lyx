If Impact Factors and paper publication is as meaningful to academic scientists

because open science isn't split into factions, but its also not a unified
 vision, its hard to say who's fighting for what.
 from reading above, you could naively say that open science fits floss
 because from a distance the movement contains both rights and production
 mechanisms.
 it would be nice if you could more clearly show that 1) these two intents
 are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but that there are factions who
 care specifically about one but perhaps not the other.

The most common narrative about open science tells us that, once upon a

 and the common good drove the everyday work of scientists.
 Then evil corporations entered science and changed the rules of the game,
 patenting life, enclosing the commons, and eventually destroying the willingnes
s to share data, information, and knowledge.
 But today, so the story goes, we have new tools that together with the
 old open science spirit and be used to rebel against evil, defeat it and
 allow scientific knowledge to flow freely again.
 These tools are open source and open access science, and they can be used
 to tear down the barriers to the access of scientific knowledge.

Science has an intimate relationship with the media, and both parties use
 each other as a tool for various goals.
 The media gets a reputable scientist figure to bolster their claims; the
 scientist gets a public venue to couch their ideas or goals in objective-but-po

 Open science rhetoric is easy to use for both purposes.

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The map uses 2011 data on Internet users and total population datasets that
 were obtained from the World Bank.
 The World Bank has tracked the number of Internet users and Internet connection
s per country since the 1990s as part of its Worldwide Governance Indicators
 project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The data are visualized with a hexagon-shaped cartogram in which the size
 of each country is drawn based on its population of Internet users.
 Each hexagon accounts for about one third of a million Internet users.
 Countries with fewer than that number have been removed from the map.
 The shading of each country reflects its Internet penetration rate: darker
 shades indicate higher levels of Internet usage in the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Findings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The distortion in the map paints a revealing picture about human activity
 on the Internet.
 China is now home to the world’s largest Internet population at over half
 a billion.
 The United States, India, and Japan then follow as the next most populous
 nations of Internet users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Looking at the largest Internet countries, we see two important trends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
First, the rise of Asia as the main contributor to the world’s Internet
 population; 42% of the world’s Internet users live in Asia, and China,
 India, and Japan alone host more Internet users than Europe and North America
 combined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Second, few of the world’s largest Internet countries fall into the top
 category (>80%) of Internet penetration (and indeed India falls into the
 lowest category, at <20% penetration).
 In other words, in all of the world’s largest Internet nations, there is
 still substantial room for growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We also see an interesting geographic pattern of Internet penetration.
 All but four of the countries with an Internet penetration rate of over
 80% are in Europe (Canada, New Zealand, Qatar, and South Korea being the
 exceptions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The map also reveals interesting patterns in some of the world’s poorest
 countries.
 Most Latin American countries now can count over 40% of their citizens
 as Internet users.
 Because of this, Latin America as a whole now hosts almost as many Internet
 users as the United States.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some African countries have seen staggering growth, whereas other have seen
 little change since we last mapped Internet use globally in 2008.
 In the last three years, almost all North African countries doubled their
 population of Internet users (Algeria being a notable exception).
 Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, also saw massive growth.
 However, it remains that over half of Sub-Saharan African countries have
 an Internet penetration of less than 10%, and have seen very little grow
 in recent years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is therefore important to remember that despite the massive impacts that
 the Internet has on everyday life for many people, most people on our planet
 remain entirely disconnected.
 Only one third of the world’s population has access to the Internet.

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The maps use the “Fixed (wired)-broadband monthly subscription charge, in
 USD” indicator published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
 in the 17th edition of the World Telecommunication/ICT Indicators Database.
 We map 2011 data, being the most recent information available for this
 indicator in the dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The ITU defines the indicator as the following: “Fixed (wired)-broadband
 monthly subscription charge refers to the monthly subscription charge for
 fixed (wired)-broadband Internet service.
 Fixed (wired) broadband is considered to be any dedicated connection to
 the Internet at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s.
 If several offers are available, preference should be given to the 256
 kbit/s connection.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The data also refer to the monthly cost of the cheapest entry-level subscription
 in any place.
 These values have been multiplied by twelve to obtain a yearly cost, and
 weighted over the gross national income per capita (Atlas method, current
 USD) data available from the World Bank, referring to the same year (2011).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The graph on the lower-left corner illustrates the evolution of the cost
 of broadband over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
Findings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This visualization speaks to one of the core themes of the global digital
 divide: the relative cost of being connected to the Internet.
 The geographies of the phenomenon could hardly be more clear, and its consequen
ces are illustrated in many other visualizations published on our website,
 from the cartogram of the Internet population to the graphic depicting
 the geographic distribution of the top-level domain names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We see that the price of a broadband connection in most parts of Africa
 is out of reach for people on average incomes.
 Said differently, Africans need to pay ten times as much of their salary
 (if looking at the ratio of income to connectivity costs) for broadband
 as people in the rest of the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A monthly broadband subscription costs about 60 USD both in Australia and
 Mozambique.
 However, while the average yearly gross income in Australia is around 50,000
 USD, the same figure in Mozambique is less than 500 USD.
 This means that while an average worker in Australia could pay for a year’s
 worth of connectivity with one week’s salary, a Mozambican worker would
 need over one and a half year’s salary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This situation does not mean that costs in Africa aren’t dropping.
 The average cost of an African Internet connection is now half of what
 it was four years ago, thanks to a series of cables laid around the African
 continent in 2009.
 Kenya and Nigeria, for instance, have 2011 broadband costs that are respectivel
y 21% and 8% of what they were in 2008.
 These changes have undoubtedly contributed to the significant growth in
 the number of Internet users seen by both countries.
 The most striking drop in broadband cost has been observed in Burkina Faso,
 which has gone from over 1,700 USD a month to a most reasonable 55 USD
 (which still, however, represents 100% of the salary of an average worker).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Eritrea is the country where the Internet is least affordable.
 A yearly subscription there is the equivalent of almost fifty year’s worth
 of an average salary: an entire life of work! Over 18 countries still face
 costs of Internet subscriptions higher than the average income, including
 14 Sub-Saharan African countries, the landlocked countries of Afghanistan
 and Tajikistan, and the islands of Kiribati and Solomon Islands.
 A broadband Internet connection cost over 500 USD a month in the Central
 African Republic, Guinea, Malawi, and Swaziland, as well as in Cuba, where,
 according to the ITU, 1,700 USD was still not enough to buy a subscription.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
India and Sri Lanka have the cheapest broadband access prices, where access
 can be obtained for as little as 6 USD a month.
 Europe and North America have higher absolute costs, ranging between about
 10 and 40 USD a month, but have some of the lowest relative costs in the
 world: with a couple of hours of work a month being sufficient for an average
 worker to afford the cost of connectivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The data mapped here are some of the world’s most important indicators.
 Without the ability and means to connect, the opportunities, the information,
 and the communication mediated and afforded by the Internet all remain
 impossible.

The ‘10/90 gap’ was first highlighted by the Global Forum for Health Research.
 It refers to the fi nding that 90% of worldwide medical research expenditure
 is targeted at problems affecting only 10% of the world’s population.
 Applying research results from the rich world to the problems of the poor
 may be a tempting, potentially easy and convenient solution for this gap.
 This paper had the objective of presenting arguments that such an approach
 runs the risk of exporting failure.

 been that such research advances social welfare in egalitarian ways.
 Yet the long service of these sciences to mili- tarism, nationalisms, profit-ma

 evidence, at least in the contemporary era, against the happy relation

the information “ specialists ” would do well to take a cue from those few

Do we really believe, for instance, that the problem of global injustice
 is one of lack of access to technology? And are we comfortable with equating
 technology solely with ICT? Whose material interests are served by such
 equations? Are we prepared to support the suggestion, embedded in daily
 utterances of “ informa- tion society, ” that majority-world dispossession
 is attributable to such commu- nities somehow not having “ enough ” information

project both draws on and recircu- lates knowledges that are anything but
 universal.
 Ferguson (1997) and Shiva (2003) both observe that “ development ” de fi
 nitions of poverty and productivity, for example, are founded on culturally
 and historically peculiar knowledges; they draw on a singularly market-based
 conception of what it means to be poor and what it means to be productive.
 The mobilization of such culturally limited knowledges as universals, in
 other words, creates discursive conditions in which the existence of indigenous
 knowledge as a valid category is inconceivable.
 The presumption, then, is that majority-world communities simply lack knowledge
 and that the answer to their dispossession in turn involves the import
 of knowl- edge from the West.
 Crewe and Harrison (1998) summarize this atti

 Our era is facing increasing global environmental and societal problems
 (e.g., climate change, habitat destruction and economic recession), necessitating
 research cooperation between industrialized and developing countries for
 certain aspects, as required by funding institutions such as the European
 Commission, the International Foundation for Science, United Nations Developmen
t Programme, World Bank, World Health Organisation, United Nations Educational,
 Scientific and Cultural Organization as well as numerous national institutions.
 Whether or not such collaboration is a requirement of the funding agencies
 within the framework of international North-South cooperation, the above-mentio
ned global importance of scientific publishing places a publishing responsibilit
y on all research institutes North and South.
 This responsibility serves not only to disseminate one’s own expertise,
 but also to justify the research carried out and, most important, to share
 information.
 In fact, the citation attractivity of internationally co-authored publications
 shows that scientific collaboration is advantageous for both developing
 and industrialized countries (Glänzel et al., 1999).
 According to Katz & Hicks (1997) and Glänzel & Schubert (2001), the type
 of collaboration affects the impact of a research publication, with an
 increase of a factor two of the average citation for collaboration with
 a foreign research institute as compared to collaboration with a domestic
 institute.

 Claims are made based on hegemonic discourses that are positioned as a

 The construction of open access as an issue of unquestionable moral necessity
 also impedes the problematisation of its own heritage.

 the study’s philosophical bases rest upon assumptions held by the open
 access movement and the open learning philosophy; assumptions not necessarily
 held by mainstream societies but which are gaining ground with the global
 adoption of Internet technologies.
 As a faculty member of an open university, I have long been an advocate
 of open courseware and open educational resources, adopting the view that
 knowledge, and thus, content, should be free.
 For sure, such views run counter to intellectual property rights (IPR)
 advocates within the academe who spouse an economic cum transactional value
 to knowledge and content.
 However, within the current information and com- munication technology
 environment, the ideal of having all explicit or documented knowledge made
 available on the Web is now a possibility.
 Furthermore, the prospect of digitally capturing all tacit or undocumented
 knowledge and also making these available openly is likewise quite real.
 Thus, within an open learning environment, the academe may no longer be
 the repository of knowledge, a position that it has occupied for almost
 a millennium.
\begin_inset Newline newline

xtending this view to indigenous knowledge systems and practices (IKSP),
 we may likewise argue that, in the spirit of openness, indigenous knowledge,
 having been the products of generations of practice and are thus steeped
 in wisdom, may likewise be made available in the Web, at the very least
 to flatten generational learning curves.
 This is particularly true in traditional agricultural and folk medicinal
 knowledge and practices, which have recently become valuable sources of
 prescriptive technologies for organic agriculture and ethnomedicine, respective
ly.
 During the conduct of the study, however, the researcher observed a marked
 reluctance from organized indigenous people’s groups to participate in
 the open access initiative.
 It soon became apparent that interfacing indigenous knowledge with open
 access concepts held complicated issues

Non-scientists might be wondering what all the fuss is about with regards
 to the open science debate that has livened up throughout the last few
 years, because they think these areas do not (directly) relate to them.
 People might think: “Why should I care about open science? I am not a researche
r, so this does not affect me.” Not just researchers but also the average
 person on the street can benefit from open science.
 Several of the most important consequences for the population include (1)
 more public scrutiny of research, (2) better research in general and (3)
 a better foundation for businesses to build their company on.
 Much research is funded by the public via tax money.
