I think that fraud has increased since I came into scientific research 40
 years ago, as the challenges of running a successful research laboratory,
 obtaining funding, and publishing papers likewise have increased.
 In the not-so-recent past, we did not have cutthroat competition to publish
 in the most prestigious journals as we do today, and grant funding flowed
 freely.
 There was enough reward to go around.
 The life of a scientist was relatively simple, so there were fewer incentives
 to cheat.

\begin_layout Quotation
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The most common narrative about open science tells us that, once upon a
 time, science was an ethical enterprise: sharing, equality, disinterest
 and the common good drove the everyday work of scientists.
 Then evil corporations entered science and changed the rules of the game,
 patenting life, enclosing the commons, and eventually destroying the willingnes
s to share data, information, and knowledge.
 But today, so the story goes, we have new tools that together with the
 old open science spirit an be used to rebel against evil, defeat it and
 allow scientific knowledge to flow freely again.
 These tools are open source and open access science, and they can be used
 to tear down the barriers to the access of scientific knowledge.

 “open source” with the openness of the development process, and “libre”
 with those concerned about confusion from the previous two.

 we create a system where one of those many sciences is designated as the

 Indigenous sciences lose by virtue of what they are -- non globalized,

e research impact? It's at least equal -- impact factors and citation count

There's also the proposal, backed by limited data, that OA makes it's greatest
 impact in increasing access and scientific participation globally, and
 specifically in the developing world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Across sub-fields, the impact of commercial online availability was positive,
 statistically significant, and on average 40% larger than the OA effect,
 suggesting that most researchers rely on institutional subscriptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The influence of OA was more than twice as strong in the developing world
 but was less apparent in the very poorest countries where electronic access
 is limited

Issues I'm running up against
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I can't actually do an anthology of open science in the developing world.
 I can't catalog all of the grassroots citizen science projects.
 I can only speak about my concerns and highlight specific projects that
 are doing well or poorly.
 It is not, by ANY means, definitive, which I resent and feel is a flaw
 in myself.
