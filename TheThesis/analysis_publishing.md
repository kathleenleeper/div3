#an analysis of open[/]science
OKAY. So, big section I've been trying to write is an analysis of open science values. How do they fit into my div? What *are* they? Do they fit into the big picture? i think they do, and I think this is how.

#keys

1. Am I criticizing *open* science, openq *science*, or *open science*?

The real question I want to ask is how to (re)-construct *open science*. But I've been flip-flopping between those three, struggling to approach the last but without an idea of how. the key is, well. I think there's a couple.

##1. [open] [digitized] Science

If Science is the package, the institution, than we can pass options to it, like LaTeX.

2. Does passing options to science *change* it?
  * tracking information
    * scary surveillance
    * aligns with personal tracking movement in health
  * data aggregration
    * makes viewpoints less accessible
    * homogenizes starting points

If we stick with the LaTeX metaphor, it changes the **presentation**, "not" the **content**.


##2. doing it for good

The OTHER key, I think, is that open science **wants to help people**. Unlike the rest of science, open science advocates openly claim that their initiatives will progress science faster, and indeed, I think projects like UsefulChem or ther things coming out of drug discovery are....helpful. They come from a place of wanting to fulfill scientific potential in *helping people*, and they SAY that.  Open science wants to engage more people in inquiry, make it more accessible and pleasurable, and share the joys of scientific research.

##3. future science is open
Open science is, likely, the closest to the future of science (looking at trends in funding and in young investigators)

And if that's true, which it seems to be, what if we start there? From a feminist point of view, what new complexities do we find when science is formatted with openness? Who is included and who is not?


#Where I come in

So that's my link. IF open science ecosystems were to prevail, WILL it accomplish its goals (of goodness and sharing and helping the world)?
Probably not, but that doesn't make it bad. It just means OS is too limited in it's goals, and at the very least needs to pair up with grassroots activists in post-colonial and feminist circles to shape their Good Initiative. Within the boundaries of Science, open science seems really A+.

*But it doesn't go far enough in re-working the **science** to complete (?) its goals.*
