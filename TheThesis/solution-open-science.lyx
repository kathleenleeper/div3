\begin_layout Quote
By far the most common argument made for open- access by scientists and
 science funders is one that springs from a widely-held belief that the
 sharing of data will lead to more rapid scientific progress and a reduc-
 tion in unnecessary duplication of scientific effort.

\begin_layout Quote
Pooling together results, it is argued, maximises the chances of spotting
 significant patterns in the data that are collected, and thus of transforming
 data into knowledge (OECD 2009, Royal Society 2012).
 This in turn may improve the quality, accessibility and transparency of
 research and speed up the rate of scientific discovery.
 Some scientists even refer to this shift as a new, ‘data-driven’ paradigm
 of research (Hey et al 2009).

Science as an institution feels like a shattered mirror.
 Knowledge is limited, disparate, disorganized, and unreliable; it lives
 behind digital paywalls contrived to keep science in the realm of the fiscally
 elite and educationally privileged, and hides tucked into papers full of
 jargon.
 Science doesn't replicate well, even when it's purely 1s and 0s: the reliabilit
y of computer programs (to present stimuli, record data, crunch numbers)
 is limited to the labs writing the program, and sometimes not even then.
 Attempts at getting access to the generative programs fail almost every
 time.
 When scientifically-minded readers try to look deeper into statistical
 manipulations, datasets typically fail to materialize;

Open science starts with the end, and a long-standing push to make journal
 articles accessible to more than just wealthy university subscribers.
 Then, it moves deeper, demanding not just the results the authors choose
 to highlight, but the data powering authorial interprations.
 But wait, how did they acquire the data? If they did it with a program,
 then we need that too.
 Everything that happens in the academic lab should be like a pharmaceutical

The most important royalty-free literature for our purposes is the body
 of peer-reviewed scientific and scholarly research articles and their preprints.
 (Non-academics are often surprised to learn that scholarly journals generally
 do not pay authors for their articles.) Obviously no one writes royalty-free
 literature for money.
 Scholars write journal articles because advancing knowledge in their fields
 advances their careers.
 They write for impact, not for money.
 It takes nothing away from a disinterested desire to advance knowledge
 to note that it is accompanied by a strong self-interest in career-building.
 OA does not depend on altruistic volunteerism.
 Because scholars do not earn money from their journal articles, they are
 very differently situated from most musicians and movie-makers.
 Controversies about OA to music, movies, and other royalty-producing content,
 therefore, do not carry over to research articles.

Once we move on from hardware, code is how many scientists interact with
 their data.
 Programs and scripts control how and when information is collected, what
 kinds of metadata we can use, how we parse, smooth, and manipulate data,
 the final presentation of data on our screens and the figures we submit
 to journals.
 From computational biology scripts to psychology stimuli, from graphing
 ecology datasets to standardizing microscope exposures and image processing,
 code, in a very real way,

I completely agree about code replication.
 It's amazing how easy it is to catch errors that go in the wrong direction

 Double-entry (recoding from scratch) really seems like the gold standard.

Open notebook science is the practice of making the entire primary record
 of a research project publicly available online as it is recorded.
 This involves placing the personal, or laboratory, notebook of the researcher
 online along with all raw and processed data, and any associated material,
 as this material is generated.

Notebooks are, plausibly, the closest thing to heart and spine of the scientific
 process.
 In addition to computer collected data, a good lab notebook tracks the
 experimenter.
 Researchers capture their in-progress thoughts, the reasons behind experiments,
 their day-to-day protocol adjustments, notes on dropped tubes or hastily
 drawn sketches of experiments.
 Notebooks are ground zero for wet lab science

 The simplest solution might just be to make notebooks open from the start.
 In an ideal world, this tracks not only eventually successful projects,
