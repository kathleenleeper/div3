Biology's point of entry into molecule-body interactions starts with receptors.
 Cell-surface receptors bind the molecule and transmit a signal, or act
 as a channel to allow direct access to the intracellular milieu; alternately,
 signaling molecules diffuse through the cell membrane and then find intracellul
ar receptors.
 Measuring and quantifying molecule-receptor interaction lies at the heart
 of pharmacology.

The first is at the receptor/effector level.
 It has been demonstrated that some hallucinogens, such as LSD, activate
 different signaling cascades than 5-HT.
 For example, at the 5-HT2C receptor, 5-HT binding produces a strong phosphoinos
itide hydrolysis response, a rise in intracellular calcium levels and phosphoryl
ation of the receptor itself.
 LSD produces robust phosphoinositide hydrolysis, however there is no concomitan
t rise in intracellular calcium and only limited phosphorylation of the
 receptor

\begin_layout Quote
On activation by exposure to their ligand, 5-HT 2 receptor sub types increase
 IP 3 levels and undergo desensitization and internalization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
To visualize the re- ceptor in cells during these processes, we have constructed
 a 5-HT 2A -enhanced GFP (SR2-GFP) fusion receptor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We show that this fusion receptor undergoes internalization on exposure
 to its natural ligand, 5-HT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Because 5-HT 2A receptors activate the phospholipase C pathway, we studied
 the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on the internalization process and
 found that activation of PKC by its specific activator phorbol 12-myristate
 13-acetate, in the absence of 5-HT, leads to internalization of the receptorq.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Moreover, inhibition of PKC by its inhibitor sphingosine in the presence
 of 5-HT prevents the internalization process, suggesting that activation
 of PKC is sufficient and necessary for the internalization of 5-HT 2A receptors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We also show that SR2-GFP recycles back to the plasma membrane after 5-HT-depend
ent internalization, suggesting a mechanism for resensitization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In addition, receptors that have been internalized on addition of phorbol
 12-myristate 13- acetate in the absence of 5-HT also recycle to the surface,
 with a time course similar to that seen after activation of the receptors
 by 5-HT.

\series bold
 Our study suggests that 5-HT 2A receptors internalize and return to the
 surface after both serotonin- and PKC-mediated processes.

By contrast, 1 mg/kg DOI produces a significant (albeit somewhat blunted)
 HTR in 5-HT 2C knockout mice [167].
 The fact that DOI can provoke head twitches in 5-HT 2C knockout mice but
 not in 5-HT 2A knockout mice strongly indicates the 5-HT 2A recep- tor
 is the member of the 5-HT 2 family responsible for mediating the HTR.
 Similarly, there is a consensus in the literature that the ability of DOI
 to induce the HTR is not blocked by selective 5-HT 2C antagonists or mixed
 5-HT 2C/2B antagonists [160,168–171].

It is not clear why the 5-HT 2C receptor attenuates the HTR in certain studies

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) refers to the phenomenon where a weak prestimulus
 presented prior to a startling stimulus will attenuate the startle response;
 PPI is often used as an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, and
 reflects central mechanisms that filter out irrelevant or distracting sensory
 stimuli.

Subjects under the influence of mescaline and LSD often report that their

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When rats are tested in unfamiliar BPM chambers after administration of
 hallucinogens (including mesca- line, DOM, DOI, LSD, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and
 psilocin), the animals display reduced amounts of locomotor activity, rearings,
 and hole- pokes at the beginning of the test session, and avoidance of
 the center of the BPM chamber is increased.
 [202-205] Most of these effects are markedly diminished in animals habituated
 to the BPM chambers, indicating that hallucinogens act by enhancing neophobia.
 The ability of hallucinogens to increase the avoidance of novel (and potentiall
y threatening) test chambers by rats may be analogous to the enhanced sensitivit
y and reactivity to environmental stimuli that occurs in humans
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Extensive testing has confirmed this pattern of effects in the BPM is highly
 specific to hallucinogens [200,207–210].
 For example, although 8-OH-DPAT and other selective 5-HT 1A agonists reduce
 locomotor activity, rearings, and holepokes in rats, these effects are
 not influenced by environmental familiarity and hence are likely to reflect
 sedation [208].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When Adams and Geyer [211] compared lisuride and LSD in the BPM, they found
 the two com- pounds produce markedly different patterns of effects.
 Lisuride produces effects that are similar to those of apomorphine and
 other dopamine agonists, with sedative effects occurring at low doses and
 perseverative patterns of hyperactivity occurring at higher doses.

Although most hallucinogens produce tolerance in humans, DMT seems to be
 the exception.
 It has been reported that DMT does not evoke tolerance in man, even after
 an intramuscular (IM) dosage regimen of 0.7 mg/kg twice daily for five days
 [227].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In vitro experiments have shown that exposure to LSD or DOI desensitizes
 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors in transfected cell lines [108,229].
 However, after exposure to DMT, 5-HT 2C receptors showed desensitization
 but there was no change in the response to 5-HT 2A activation [108].
 These observations suggest that DMT fails to induce tolerance because it
 does not desensitize the 5-HT 2A receptor.

multistate ligand binding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The 5-HT 2A receptor demonstrates multistate ligand binding (Branchek et
 al, 1990; Teitler at el.
 1990).
 This means that there are two conformations of the receptor, each with
 a different affinity for ligand.
 These two states exist in equilibrium.
 The active, high affinity state activates effector pathways while the inactive,
 low affinity state does not.
 Agonists bind to the high affinity state, stabilize its conformation and
 increase effector activity.
 Another class of ligand called inverse agonists binds preferentially to
 the low affinity state and stabilizes it.
 This actually leads to a decrease in spontaneous activity.
 A third class of ligand called neutral antagonists can bind to either state,
 and as neutral antagonists, do not change the equilibrium state between
 the two conformations and do not alter effector activity.

The scientific justification for model systems is the essential role they
 play in reducing a complex biological into simple working units.
 Model neuronal systems in a dish provide a carefully controlled environment,
 to the exclusion of external elements (rogue hormone fluctuations, mental
 activities of rodents/humans); the cell type can be isolated and studied
 as a single cell acting individually (more accurately, a single cell surrounded
 by thousands of identical single cells), allowing for specific genetic
 and environmental manipulations.

An issue with many of the studies on functional selectivity is the cell-lines,
 especially for an effect that is highly-dependent on so many factors.
 While some are done on mice and primary cortical neurons, many more are
 done with transient transfections into HEK293 (human kidney/adrenal), C6
 glioma (rat astrocyte), NIH-3T3 (mouse embryo), or CHO (hamster ovaries)
 cell lines, as well as 
\emph on

\emph default
 oocytes.
 None of these reproduce the structural regulation of dendritic spines,
 and may not express the same intracellular signaling milieu.
 On the other hand, a cell line that
