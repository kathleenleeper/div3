 synthesis of

Biology's point of entry into molecule-body interactions starts with receptors.
 Cell-surface receptors bind the molecule and transmit a signal, or act
 as a channel to allow direct access to the intracellular milieu; alternately,
 signalling molecules diffuse through the cell membrane and then find intracellu
lar receptors.
 Measuring and quantifying molecule-receptor interaction lies at the heart
 of pharmacology.

Because biology focuses on the receptor-ligand interactions as the site
 of action, and downstream effects as the consequence, this is where we
 pick up.
 Our area of interest becomes very narrow: the elucidation of the intracellular
 signaling pathways activated by the stereoelectronic perturbation and conformat
ional movement of specific amino acid residues at the shared binding site
 of psychedelic hallucinogens, ideally while maintaining the most

-like intracellular environment possible.
 The grand goal remaining, of course, to explain how a small molecule can
 (sometimes) irrevocably shake loose long-held notions of self and meaning.

The central serotonergic neurons [5–hydroxytryptamine (5–HT) neurons] are
 sever- al clusters of neurons located bilaterally along the midline and
 in the adjacent reti- cular formation of the brainstem.
 These neurons project widely to almost every part of the brain and spinal
 cord, and thereby modulate a variety of developmental pro- cesses and animal
 behaviors.
 A deregulation of the 5–HT level in the central nervous system might contribute
 to numerous psychiatric disorders, including fear, aggres- sion, depression,
 and anxiety, and to pain modulation.
 The recent identification of 5–HT-specific transcription factors and the
 genetic manipulation of these factors in mice have begun to unveil molecular
 mechanisms underlying the specification, differentiation, survival, and
 maintenance of the central 5–HT neurons.
 This chap- ter summarizes some of recent advances about transcriptional
 control of 5–HT neuron development, and highlights the results from gene-target
ing experiments in mice.
 The discussion concentrates on two classes of transcription factors.
 One class, represented by Nkx2.2 and Mash1, is expressed in 5–HT progenitor
 cells residing within the ventricular zone.
 The second class, represented by Lmx1b and Pet1, is expressed in 5–HT postmitot
ic neurons only.
 The comparison of different mutant lines that lack an individual transcription
 factor has permitted us to speculate about their relationship during the
 development of 5–HT neurons.
 Finally, behavioral study of knockout mice with impaired 5–HT systems have
 shown the involvement of some transcription factors in the etiology of
 psychiatric abnormalities.

ome studies have found that lisuride produces full substitution in rats
 trained with either LSD, DOI, or DOM [136–139], but in other studies it
 pro- duced only partial substitution [129,140].
 Although clearly some degree of similarity exists between the stimulus
 cues evoked by lisuride and classical hallucinogens, there are also subtle
 differ- ences because rats can be trained to discriminate between lisuride
 and LSD using three-choice (drug–drug–vehicle) discrimination procedures
 [141].
 Discrimination studies where animals are trained to discriminate between
 LSD and another drug such as pentobar- bital or cocaine also appear to
 be less sensitive to lisuride-induced false-positive responses [139].

By contrast, 1 mg/kg DOI produces a significant (albeit somewhat blunted)
 HTR in 5-HT 2C knockout mice [167].
 The fact that DOI can provoke head twitches in 5-HT 2C knockout mice but
 not in 5-HT 2A knockout mice strongly indicates the 5-HT 2A recep- tor
 is the member of the 5-HT 2 family responsible for mediating the HTR.
 Similarly, there is a consensus in the literature that the ability of DOI
 to induce the HTR is not blocked by selective 5-HT 2C antagonists or mixed
 5-HT 2C/2B antagonists [160,168–171].

It is not clear why the 5-HT 2C receptor attenuates the HTR in certain studies

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) refers to the phenomenon where a weak prestimulus

 PPI is often used as an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, and

 measuring the quantitative and qualitiative spatial and temporal structure

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When rats are tested in unfamiliar BPM chambers after administration of
 hallucinogens (including mesca- line, DOM, DOI, LSD, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, and
 psilocin), the animals display reduced amounts of locomotor activity, rearings,
 and hole- pokes at the beginning of the test session, and avoidance of
 the center of the BPM chamber is increased.
 [202-205] Most of these effects are markedly diminished in animals habituated
 to the BPM chambers, indicating that hallucinogens act by enhancing neophobia.
 The ability of hallucinogens to increase the avoidance of novel (and potentiall
y threatening) test chambers by rats may be analogous to the enhanced sensitivit
y and reactivity to environmental stimuli that occurs in humans
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Extensive testing has confirmed this pattern of effects in the BPM is highly
 specific to hallucinogens [200,207–210].
 For example, although 8-OH-DPAT and other selective 5-HT 1A agonists reduce
 locomotor activity, rearings, and holepokes in rats, these effects are
 not influenced by environmental familiarity and hence are likely to reflect
 sedation [208].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When Adams and Geyer [211] compared lisuride and LSD in the BPM, they found
 the two com- pounds produce markedly different patterns of effects.
 Lisuride produces effects that are similar to those of apomorphine and
 other dopamine agonists, with sedative effects occurring at low doses and
 perseverative patterns of hyperactivity occurring at higher doses.

 It has been reported that DMT does not evoke tolerance in man, even after

 [227].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In vitro experiments have shown that exposure to LSD or DOI desensitizes
 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors in transfected cell lines [108,229].
 However, after exposure to DMT, 5-HT 2C receptors showed desensitization
 but there was no change in the response to 5-HT 2A activation [108].
 These observations suggest that DMT fails to induce tolerance because it
 does not desensitize the 5-HT 2A receptor.

multistate ligand binding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The 5-HT 2A receptor demonstrates multistate ligand binding (Branchek et
 al, 1990; Teitler at el.
 1990).
 This means that there are two conformations of the receptor, each with
 a different affinity for ligand.
 These two states exist in equilibrium.
 The active, high affinity state activates effector pathways while the inactive,
 low affinity state does not.
 Agonists bind to the high affinity state, stabilize its conformation and
 increase effector activity.
 Another class of ligand called inverse agonists binds preferentially to
 the low affinity state and stabilizes it.
 This actually leads to a decrease in spontaneous activity.
 A third class of ligand called neutral antagonists can bind to either state,
 and as neutral antagonists, do not change the equilibrium state between
 the two conformations and do not alter effector activity.

WHEN A LIGAND such as a hormone, neurotransmitter, or glycoprotein interacts
 with a heptahelical receptor on the surface of the cell, the ligand either
 stabilizes or induces a conformation in the receptor that activates a heterotri
meric G protein (composed of α-, β-, and γ-subunits) on the inner membrane
 surface of the cell (1).
 In the inactive heterotrimeric state, GDP is bound to the Gα-subunit.
 Upon activation, GDP is released, GTP binds to Gα, and subsequently Gα-GTP
 dissociates from Gβγ and from the receptor (Fig.
 1).
 Both Gα-GTP and Gβγ are then free to activate downstream effectors.
 The duration of the signal is determined by the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis
 rate of the Gα-subunit and the subsequent reassociation of Gα-GDP with
 Gβγ (1, 2).
 This article will review current knowledge and recent progress in defining
 the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activity and specificity of
 G protein signaling cascades.
 In addition, we will briefly discuss the use of dynamic experimental approaches
 that are likely to provide new insights into G protein regulation in the
 future..

According to current knowledge, 16 genes encode for Gα-subunits, five genes
 encode for Gβ-, and 12 genes encode for Gγ-subunits (10).
 Classically, G proteins are divided into four families based on similarity
 of their α-subunits: Gαi/o, Gαs, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13 (Table 1).
 Gα-subunits contain two domains: a GTPase domain that is involved in the
 binding and hydrolysis of GTP and a helical domain that buries the GTP
 within the core of the protein (Fig.
 2A).
 The helical domain is the most divergent domain among Gα families and may
 play a role in directing specificity of receptor- and effector-G protein
 coupling.
 Comparison of Gαt-GDP and Gαt-GTPγS crystal structures has revealed the
 presence of three flexible regions, designated switches I, II, and III,
 which become more rigid and well ordered in the GTP-bound active conformation
 (3, 4).
 Little is known about the structure of the extreme amino (N-) and carboxy
 (C-) terminal domains of Gα-subunits because in the isolated G protein
 crystal structures solved thus far, the N and C termini of Gα were either
 removed from the protein or disordered (3, 4, 5, 6).
 However, in two separate crystal structures of heterotrimeric complex,
 the N-terminal helix is ordered by its interaction with the β-propeller
 domain of Gβ (Refs.
 7 and 8 and Fig.
 2A).
 Biochemical studies suggest that these terminal regions play a key role
 in the activation process and in directing specific protein-protein interaction
s, as is discussed in the following section.

The heterotrimeric G protein consists of an α-subunit that binds and hydrolyzes
 GTP as well as of a β- and a γ-subunit that form an undissociable complex
 (233, 255, 475).
 Several subtypes of α-, β-, and γ-subunits have been described (Table 2).
 To dynamically couple activated receptors to effectors, the heterotrimeric
 G protein undergoes an activation-inactivation cycle (Fig.
 1).
 In the basal state, the βγ-complex and the GDP-bound α-subunit are associated,
 and the heterotrimer can be recognized by an appropriate activated receptor.
 Coupling of the activated receptor to the heterotrimer promotes the exchange
 of GDP for GTP on the G protein α-subunit.
 The GTP-bound α-subunit dissociates from the activated receptor as well
 as from the βγ-complex, and both the α-subunit and the βγ-complex are now
 free to modulate the activity of a variety of effectors like ion channels
 or enzymes.
 Signaling is terminated by the hydrolysis of GTP by the GTPase activity,
 which is inherent to the G protein α-subunit.
 The resulting GDP-bound α-subunit reassociates with the βγ-complex to enter
 a new cycle if activated receptors are present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
A G protein alpha subunit binds either GTP or GDP depending on whether the
 protein is active (GTP) or inactive (GDP).
 In the absence of a signal, GDP attaches to the alpha subunit, and the
 entire G protein-GDP complex binds to a nearby GPCR.
 This arrangement persists until a signaling molecule joins with the GPCR.
 At this point, a change in the conformation of the GPCR activates the G
 protein, and GTP physically replaces the GDP bound to the alpha subunit.
 As a result, the G protein subunits dissociate into two parts: the GTP-bound
 alpha subunit and a beta-gamma dimer.
 Both parts remain anchored to the plasma membrane, but they are no longer
 bound to the GPCR, so they can now diffuse laterally to interact with other
 membrane proteins.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Whenever a G protein is active, both its GTP-bound alpha subunit and its
 beta-gamma dimer can relay messages in the cell by interacting with other
 membrane proteins involved in signal transduction.
 Specific targets for activated G proteins include various enzymes that
 produce second messengers, as well as certain ion channels that allow ions
 to act as second messengers.
 Some G proteins stimulate the activity of these targets, whereas others
 are inhibitory.
 Vertebrate genomes contain multiple genes that encode the alpha, beta,
 and gamma subunits of G proteins.
 The many different subunits encoded by these genes combine in multiple
 ways to produce a diverse family of G proteins (Figure 2).

####Intrinsic Efficacy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
...effects are governed by two important properties: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
1) affinity, the property of attraction between a ligand and its receptor,
 and 2) efficacy, the property that allows ligands, once bound, to produce
 a response (Kenakin, 1997).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This concept has led to the classification of receptor ligands as full agonists,
 partial agonists, neutral antagonists, or inverse agonists.
 Perhaps the key idea that governs this classification is the notion of
 “intrinsic efficacy”, originally proposed by Furchgott (1966) as a measure
 of the stimulus per receptor molecule produced by a ligand.
 According to this notion, full agonists possess sufficiently high intrinsic
 effi- cacy, such that they maximally stimulate all cellular re- sponses
 linked to a given receptor.
 Partial agonists possess lower degrees of intrinsic efficacy (leading to
 submaximal responses), whereas inverse agonists reduce constitutive (li-
 gand-independent, basal) receptor signaling.
 Neutral antag- onists possess no intrinsic efficacy but occupy the receptor
 to block the effects of full, partial, or inverse agonists.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This idea has also led to the assumption, dearly held in pharmacology, that
 the ability of the ligand to impart (or reduce) stimulus once that ligand
 is bound to the receptor is an inherent property of the ligand-receptor
 complex.
 Intrinsic efficacy is thus differentiated from the more operational term
 “intrinsic activity” (Ariens, 1954) that simply refers to the maximal effect

 ) of a ligand relative to a reference agonist in a given experimental system.
 Therefore, in classical pharmacological terms, intrinsic ef- ficacy has
 been viewed as a system-independent parameter that is constant for each
 ligand at a given receptor, irrespec- tive of where that receptor is expressed\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In other words, the classification of compounds on the basis of intrinsic
 efficacy only allowed for variations in the quantity of the stimulus that
 was imparted to the cell, but not the quality\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In fact, the notion that intrinsic efficacy is system-independent forms
 a major underlying premise in drug discovery today—that the pharmacological
 characteristics of a drug tested in an experimental model system can be
 extrapolated to all systems.
 As discussed below, this premise is frequently incorrect.

On activation by exposure to their ligand, 5-HT 2 receptor subtypes increase

To visualize the re- ceptor in cells during these processes, we have constructed

\begin_layout Quote
We show that this fusion receptor undergoes internalization on exposure
 to its natural ligand, 5-HT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Because 5-HT 2A receptors activate the phospholipase C pathway, we studied
 the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on the internalization process and
 found that activation of PKC by its specific activator phorbol 12-myristate
 13-acetate, in the absence of 5-HT, leads to internalization of the receptorq.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Moreover, inhibition of PKC by its inhibitor sphingosine in the presence
 of 5-HT prevents the internalization process, suggesting that activation
 of PKC is sufficient and necessary for the internalization of 5-HT 2A receptors.

 The augmentation of 5-HT 2A receptor signal- ing by PSD-95 was not accompanied

Hallucinogens, including mescaline, psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide
 (LSD), profoundly affect perception, cognition, and mood.
 All known drugs of this class are 5-HT 2A receptor (2AR) agonists, yet
 closely related 2AR agonists such as lisuride lack comparable psychoactive
 properties.
 Why only certain 2AR agonists are hallucinogens and which neural circuits
 mediate their effects are poorly understood.
 By geneti- cally expressing 2AR only in cortex, we show that 2AR-regulated
 pathways on cortical neu- rons are sufficient to mediate the signaling
 pat- tern and behavioral response to hallucinogens.
 Hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 2AR agonists both regulate signaling
 in the same 2AR-expressing cortical neurons.
 However, the signaling and behavioral responses to the hallucinogens are
 distinct.

 # S [guanosine 5Ј-3-O-(thio)- triphosphate]-sensitive [ 125 I](theta)-DOI
 binding in DOI-treated cells.
 These results suggest that DOI treatment causes down- regulation of 5-HT
 2A receptors and reductions in G protein- coupled 5-HT 2A receptors.
 In contrast, in cells transfected with the phosphorylation state mimic
 G ␣ 11 S154D, GTP  S-sensitive [ 125 I](theta)-DOI binding was decreased
 by 48%; however, there was no significant difference in the K D and B max

To determine whether DOI increases phosphorylation of G q/11 protein in

 Seven days of DOI treatment significantly decreased phospholipase C activity

The scientific justification for model systems is the essential role they
 play in reducing a complex biological into simple working units.
 Model neuronal systems in a dish provide a carefully controlled environment,
 to the exclusion of external elements (rogue hormone fluctuations, mental
 activities of rodents/humans); the cell type can be isolated and studied
 as a single cell acting individually (more accurately, a single cell surrounded
 by thousands of identical single cells), allowing for specific genetic
 and environmental manipulations.
