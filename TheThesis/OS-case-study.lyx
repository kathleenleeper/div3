It's also (I think) the easiest for an undergraduate biologist to implement.
 I don't publish, yet, so I can't publish any papers open access.s I don't
 generate a lot of data or have datasets, so publishing a data note for
 others to analyze is out of the question, and of course, since I'm not
 publishing I can't publish supplemental data.

So, starting from scratch, making all of my labwork openly accessible is
 the first and easiest way to implement open science.
 My efforts were inspired and guided by other proponents and practicers

Open notebook science is the practice of making the entire primary record
 of a research project publicly available online as it is recorded.
 This involves placing the personal, or laboratory, notebook of the researcher
 online along with all raw and processed data, and any associated material,
 as this material is generated.

The first open notebook, and the originator of the term, was Jean Claude-Bradley
, a chemist, in a blog post in 2006:

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
By this [Open Notebook Science] I mean that there is a URL to a laboratory
 notebook (like this) that is freely available and indexed on common search
 engines.
 It does not necessarily have to look like a paper notebook but it is essential
 that all of the information available to the researchers to make their
 conclusions is equally available to the rest of the world.

A second and more technically minded scientist is Carl Boettinger, a mathematica

 2010.

 His technical model for sharing his scientific progress is one that I emulated
 -- the technicalities are detailed elsewhere, but it relies on minimal
 HTML, CSS, and coding knowledge to produce a reasonably clean and logical
 website, with lab notebook entries and any other relevant pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With that, I've been keeping my online notebook more or less in sync with
 my physical labwork since the first entry on July 15, 2014.
 All the entries are timestamped and track revisions, and are written in
 human-readable HTML Markdown.

Because paper notes don't translate perfectly to typed text (see
