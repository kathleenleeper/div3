Figures showing mRNA expression of various GPCR related proteins in HEK cell

FIG 1 microarray analysis of mRNA levels of Class A GPCRs with known ligands for HEK293, AtT20, BV2 and N18 cell lines. The gray line indicates the threshold of statistical significance and the dark bars are proteins for which statistically significant levels of mRNA were detected. White bars indicate levels of mRNA for proteins that were present, but did not reach statistical significance. Abbreviation: 5-HT = 5-hydroxytryptamine; GNRH = Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone.
