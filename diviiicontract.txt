My Division III goal is simple: reconcile the inherent values and assumptions of my scientific production with my personal ones. The two are interlaced, of course, and “values” encapsulates years of academic and personal work. I'm interested in open (neuro) science, both as a growing phenomenon in science and as an active participant myself, while also deconstructing and recreating science and open biology as a value-driven enterprise.
The neuroscience/biology aspect of my work is a comparatively small technical question.  Can introducing a set of transcription factors into stem cells change their differentiation fate, thus making P19 stem cells a useful model system for dealing with serotonin receptors? With more time, I'd also explore different ligand binding to the receptor and downstream signaling effects, but that's likely to be an extreme stretch goal.
Using that research as a small model of it's own, I'm exploring the theories behind and making of “open science”. I'm making – practicing – open science with an open lab notebook, which is, granted, mostly for my benefit. But it's also a way  to document my  fact creation process, and developing ways based on first-hand experience to make open science & technology more useful and accessible to biologists.
The encapsulating question, and the heart and spine of my Div III, is an analysis of the hidden logic implicit/inherent in open neuroscience, and finding ways to challenge and redirect my work to align with feminist, anti-racist, and anti-colonialist values.
