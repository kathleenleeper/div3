title: Who Can Make Science? Access and Representation in the Culture of Science

#ABSTRACT
a talk on linking the flow of scientific information to gender and geographical disparities in scientific production

##fun facts:
 * In biology papers from 1990-2011, ~15% of last authors on papers were female.
 * The U.S. and the U.K. jointly publish more high-profile journals than the rest of the world combined.	
I'm talking about barriers -- legal and monetary-- to the flow of scientific information.

#QUESTIONS YOU CAN SAY YES TO:
 1. Have you ever written a scientific paper?
 2.  Have you ever had access issues -- not being able to get to papers you want, when you want? This includes if you have to use a friend's or UMass library account (I use an MIT logon), and excludes interlibrary loan requests, because realistically we don't make them very often.
<!---(3) how many of you pay attention to the publisher and make decisions accordingly?--- >

#intro

my goal with this talk -- which will hopefully be brief so we can actually talk more generally -- is to link a couple of fields that don't cite each other at all. Namely, the so-called "serials" and "reproducibility" crisis in the scientific literature, and the trouble with representation in scientific communities.

##scientific crises

By serials crisis, I refer to the high monetary and legal costs of interacting with journal literature. Subscription costs are prohibitive for scholars (i.e. their libraries), as well for community members, independent researchers, professors at community colleges -- like with job postings, 90% aren't even known.
The legal restrictions prevent the development of new semantic technologies to mine papers, aggregrate data, pull out trends  -- do anything, really, to make the deluge of scientific literature plausibly more meaningful; it also reduces our ability to manipulate that data into a more broadly useful form; something I'll come back to in a little bit.

The reproducibility crisis, of course, refers to something known in this building -- there's been at least one CS talk discussing this. In essence: why can't we reproduce science? It's a pronounced concern in psychology -- e.g. the declining presence of effects over time -- but it also exists in biology and "harder" fields. Retractions from journals are growing, albeit slowly, but more insidiously, things don't always work the second time.
Code is subtly wrong -- semantic vs. syntactic errors. (Based on science studies, I might argue this reproducibility crisis stems from the structure of science, not any recent developments in funding pressures, but I won't go into that here. Unless you ask.)

So this is all in regards to The Literature -- that holy grail of knowledge, or whatever. Primary lit., key to the future, cutting edge, kinda.

##representation 

Okay, now that's done, let's move back out a little bit. Representation. Who -- in terms of racial, gendered, geographical areas -- is making science? I'm going to talk pretty generally about bibliometric studies, and then my own field, so that we have something to work off of. **MAPS TIME.** 

###making science
Generally: most scientific production occurs in the U.S., followed by the U.K., followed by Europe. The geographical imbalance is staggering, if not surprising. [[map!]] It's balanced a little bit in the past 10 or so years,  but most of the literature, especially the most high-profile literature, is from the "West". 

Gender: haha, women are underrepresented! No, seriously. Of course there are more women now than 10 or 20 years ago. And of course it varies by field -- in things like education and subsets of biology, numbers are almost 50/50. But on the whole, gender bias exists, especially when you take into account relative rankings of importance. Basically, as you go up the education ladder -- from undergraduates to graduate to post-docs and finally (maybe) professorship, women and minority groups drop out at much faster rates than white men, leaving you with a nastily imbalanced power dynamic. in science, we can see this when we look at author order -- or at least in the biological sciences. First author and last author are generally the most prestigious -- first author being the one who's done the lab work and whose thesis it likely is, while last author is the P.I. - primary investigator -- who wrote the grant and oversaw the project. While women, in terms of brute numbers, are making strides towards equity, they are significantly less visible in first and last author positions. Moreover, citation analyses reveal similar kinds of patterns -- papers authored by women or with women in prominent positions receive less citations (on average) than those with men.

Probably not everybody's being sexist, but really.

###subjects of science
neglected tropical diseases.
research on white undergraduates.
clinical trials on first world problems

##my own shit
I thought it might be worthwhile to, as it were, check my privilege. I'm white, read as female, and I'm at Hampshire -- so how am I doing on my own standards? Or, less personally, how does my field (psychedelic research and feminist science studies) fare on these kinds of measurements?
Realistically, [[probably not well]]



##maps
 * geography of world knowledge: Wow, literally the U.S., and U.K produce like most of the "good" literature. Wow. Nigeria and S.A. are on there! Let's superimpose maps of Europe and of Africa as well.


#linkages?
the open access movement and open science movement is something I'm very dedicated to. PLoS is my favorite.
