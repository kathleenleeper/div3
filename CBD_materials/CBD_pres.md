My Div III works on finding a feminist & global context for two scientific projects. The first is my own research (in Cole) on the cellular-molecular pathways of 'classical psychedelics';  the other is an examination of scientific structures (e.g. access to lit., the reproducibility 'crisis') and  proposed solutions.



please let me talk about my giant sprawling div.
