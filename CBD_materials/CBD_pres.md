title: Who Can Make Science? Access and Representation in the Culture of Science

#Abstract
a talk on linking the flow of scientific information to gender and geographical disparities in scientific production
	

I'm talking about barriers -- legal and monetary-- to the flow of scientific information.

#QUESTIONS YOU CAN SAY YES TO!
 1. Have you ever written a scientific paper?
 2.  Have you ever had access issues -- not being able to get to papers you want, when you want? This includes if you have to use a friend's or UMass library account (I use an MIT logon), and excludes interlibrary loan requests, because realistically we don't make them very often.
<!---3. Do you think [the scientific establishment] suffers from a gender/race problem? -->
4. Is this something you consider in the authors you cite?
5. Are you familiar with the researchers in your field -- if you have a topic, do you have certain labs or groups that you know about? Do you know 

<!---(3) how many of you pay attention to the publisher and make decisions accordingly?--- >

#intro

my goal with this talk -- which will hopefully be brief so we can actually talk more generally -- is to link a couple of fields that don't cite each other at all. Namely, the so-called "serials" <!--and "reproducibility"--> crisis in the scientific literature, and the trouble with representation in scientific communities.
---caveat of women: what is a woman? is it a karyotype, XX? hormones? the presence of a uterus? the presence of a clitoris?


##fun facts:
 * In biology papers from 1990-2011, ~15% of last authors on papers were female. [define last authors]
* get numbers on population
 * The U.S. and the U.K. jointly publish more high-profile journals than the rest of the world combined.

#scientific crises

By serials crisis, I refer to the high monetary, legal, and digital-divide costs of interacting with journal literature. Subscription costs are prohibitive for scholars (i.e. their libraries), as well for community members, independent researchers, professors at community colleges. 

The legal restrictions prevent the development of new semantic technologies to mine papers, aggregrate data, pull out trends  -- do anything, really, to make the deluge of scientific literature plausibly more meaningful; it also reduces our ability to manipulate that data into a more broadly useful form; something I'll come back to in a little bit.

<!--The reproducibility crisis, of course, refers to something known in this building -- there's been at least one CS talk discussing this. In essence: why can't we reproduce science? It's a pronounced concern in psychology -- e.g. the declining presence of effects over time -- but it also exists in biology and "harder" fields. Retractions from journals are growing, albeit slowly, but more insidiously, things don't always *work* the second time.-->

Code is subtly wrong -- semantic vs. syntactic errors. 

Based on science studies, I might argue this reproducibility crisis stems from the structure of science, not any recent developments in funding pressures, but I won't go into that here. Unless you ask.

So this is all in regards to The Literature -- that holy grail of knowledge, or whatever. Primary lit., key to the future, cutting edge, kinda.

##representation 

Okay, now that's done, let's move back out a little bit. Representation. Who -- in terms of racial, gendered, geographical areas -- is making science? I'm going to talk pretty generally about bibliometric studies, and then my own field, so that we have something to work off of. **MAPS TIME.** 

###making science
Generally: most scientific production occurs in the U.S., followed by the U.K., followed by Europe. The geographical imbalance is staggering, if not surprising. [[map: high profile journal disribution]] It's balanced a little bit in the past 10 or so years,  but most of the literature, especially the most high-profile literature, is from the "West". [[map: where is literature happening/which collaborations]]

Gender: haha, women are underrepresented! No, seriously. Of course there are more women now than 10 or 20 years ago. And of course it varies by field -- in things like education and subsets of biology, numbers are almost 50/50. But on the whole, gender bias exists, especially when you take into account relative rankings of importance. As you go up the education ladder -- from undergraduates to graduate to post-docs and finally (maybe) professorship, women and minority groups drop out at much faster rates than white cis men, leaving you with a nastily imbalanced power dynamic. We know this anecdotally, but it's backed up by the numbers.

We can see this when we look at author order, at least in the biological sciences. First author and last author are generally the most prestigious -- first author being the one who's done the lab work and whose thesis it likely is, while last author is the P.I. - primary investigator -- who wrote the grant and oversaw the project. While women, in terms of brute numbers, are making strides towards equity, they are significantly less visible in first and last author positions. 

Moreover, citation analyses reveal similar kinds of patterns -- papers authored by women or with women in prominent positions receive less citations (on average) than those with men; it's not that everybody is discriminating against gendered names, although I'm sure that exists, but indicative that the positions and research done by women might tend to be less funded and from less prominent locations.

###subjects of science
Running through a couple of issues that I think many of might be familiar with -- tropical diseases, despite their death toll, are understudied by academic/clinical/pharmaceuticals. Trials that are run on diseases of the poor are run by the rich, often focusing on "purely" biological phenomena. Most biological research, especially psychology but biology as well, is done on White Undergraduates. 

10/90 problem 10% of the world's resouaces on 90% of the problems.
Neglected tropical disease: Mel? Ebola! 

the really good example of this, actually, is one you may be familiar with, is the symptoms of heart attack. **question: what are the symptoms of a heart attack, class?** Classically, this is crushing chest pain and pain down the left arm. 
Women, however, might have pain focused on their back and jaw -- "non-classic" symptoms.
Women generally wait longer than ment before going to the emergency room. As a result, women die more often then men. If women were the subject of more cardiovascular attention, those would not be "non-classic" symptoms -- we would be taught that pain from a heart attack could manifest in your chest, arm, back, or jaw -- less women would have died.

As an additional layer of complexity, it's unclear what variables actually account for this in terms of gender (or sex?) Presumably it's some combination of karyotype (presumed XX), hormonal distribution (presumed estrogen), body structure etc.

neglected tropical diseases.
research on white undergraduates.
clinical trials on South vs North by Southern or Northern researchers?

##my own shit
I thought it might be worthwhile to, as it were, check my privilege. I'm white, read as female, and I'm at Hampshire -- so how am I doing on my own standards? Or, less personally, how does my field (psychedelic research and feminist science studies) fare on these kinds of measurements?
My gender distribution looks like this [[gender_distr.png]]. This is generated automatically by a script that runs through my citation library, assigns gender based on first name, and then counts relative numbers, so someone like David Nichols, who appears in my library at least 5 times, is counted 5 times. It's

#linkages?
the open access movement and open science movement is something I'm very dedicated to. PLoS is my favorite! But who's actually published in PLoS?

#Notes

###maps

 * geography of world knowledge: Wow, literally the U.S., and U.K produce like most of the "good" literature. Wow. Nigeria and S.A. are on there! Let's superimpose maps of Europe and of Africa as well.
