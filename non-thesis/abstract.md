Psychedelic drugs are part of countercultural movements, used as spiritual tools, and are scientifically a pharmacological paradox. Most psychedelics act through a single common receptor, but similar compounds at the same receptor do not cause psychedelic effects. One aspect of this is the differential activation of intracellular signaling pathways, with important implications for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addictions by psychedelic drugs.
