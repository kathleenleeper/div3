, and are dismissed as heterodox because of socially, economically, and
 politically dominant Europeans are.
 Indigenous peoples still exist in large and flourishing numbers; at the
 time of colonization, Europeans had an almost negligible technological
 superiority to indigenous North Americans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practical ways, North American sciences have surpassed western -- much
 more is known about Greenland sharks by Inuit fisherman than westerners.

\begin_layout Quote
Several traditional indigenous plant medicines are only collected at night.
 I suspect that several such plants have CAM photosynthesis, hence are more
 acidic at night, which can alter efficacies of medicines.
 Finding plant medicines is often not serendipitous, but a matter of listening
 to and watching others, including non-human animals.
 How do I decide when to tap sugar maples (Acer saccharum)? I donâ€™t read
 a book, look at a calendar, check the weather forecast, or ask commercial
 producers, but instead watch the grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis),
 which only chew maple buds to release the sugars once the sap is running.

what is science?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As western philosophers struggle with demarcating science, so do we have
 trouble with indigenous scienses.
 For Gorelick, science is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anything that is Bayesian.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Both western and indigenous sciences strive for explanation and prediction;
 both start with prior probabilities, update those with new data, to form
 auxiliary hypothoses.
 Gorelick proposes a probability skill for science; that implies no marked
 demarcation between science and pseudo-.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The typical scientific unit is not a single explanation, but a program of
 research: a systematic exploration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Western and indigenous sciences are like Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry:
 valid ways of knowing, but starting with different axioms and thus ending
 with different results.

 Not all science, and not all Western science, is reductionist - much is
 observational and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Indigenous science is the same way, relying on natural experiments arising

to a large extent, the idea of a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Science and religions both in business of providing explanations to phenomena;
 and then extrapolating from those explanations.
 Indigenous science do this as well: to live off the land requires accurate
 predictions of environmental conditions and resources - survival depends
 on it.
 Knowledge is accumulated through oral storytelling and refinement - training
 of new generations is similar to the traditions of western teachings to
 younger scientists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
what are indigenous sciences?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indigenous scholars have not made this a quest, although this is possibly
 a reflection of the local nature of indigenous knowledges; this is opposition
 to the supposed conformity of Western sciences, relying on standardizing
 information to share amongst people who don't necessarily live in the same
 region.
